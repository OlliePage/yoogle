## How It Works

Yoogle uses content scripts that load at document start to detect when you're on YouTube's homepage. It efficiently replaces the interface with a minimalist version before the original content is displayed, eliminating any flash of unwanted content. 

The extension preserves YouTube's core functionality while removing the distracting elements and uses Chrome's storage API for persistent settings.
